# The story so far
* ***irresponsiblyrecode.sh*** : a script that would find every files in the current active directory and all the subdirectory/ies ***(!!!)*** and use ffmpeg to transcode all compatible files into x265 HEVC mp4.
* ***clickbast.sh*** : a script that takes a number as command line arguments and use xdotool to repeat a very specific sequence of mouse movements and clicks. I will not elaborate.
